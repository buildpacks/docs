A **build plan** is a `toml` file that is the output of the [detect](https://buildpacks.io/docs/for-buildpack-authors/concepts/lifecycle-phases/#phase-2-detect) phase, in which each component buildpack or image extension may express the dependencies it requires and the dependencies it provides.

Before we dive into more details, let's explain the difference between three terms relevant to the concept of `build plan`.

* First, the [build plan](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/buildpack.md#build-plan-toml) piece that is contributed by the buildpack during the `detect` phase. This piece is seen as the `build plan` from buildpack's perspective and is written to a temporary directory by the buildpack.

* Second, the concatenation of all buildpacks contributions that passed `detect`, which is considered the true [build plan](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/platform.md#plantoml-toml) from the platform's perspective. This file usually gets written to the `<layers>` directoryâ€”unless the platform provided another path for it.

* Finally, the build plan piece that is shown to the buildpack during the `build` phase that is referred to as the [buildpack plan](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/buildpack.md#buildpack-plan-toml). This file only contains dependencies that a buildpack is responsible for providing; however a buildpack may choose NOT to provide any of these dependencies, leaving that work for a future buildpack. The `buildpack plan` file is usually written to a temporary directory by the `lifecycle`.

## Example Build Plan (toml)

In order to make contributions to the `Build Plan`, a `/bin/detect` executable MUST write entries to `<plan>` in two sections: `requires` and `provides`. The generated `plan.toml` file is usually added under the `<layers>`directory.
The `requires` and `provides` sections MAY be repeated together inside of an `or` array at the top-level.  
Each `requires` and `provides` section MUST be a list of entries formatted as shown below:

```toml
[[provides]]
name = "<dependency name>"

[[requires]]
name = "<dependency name>"

[requires.metadata]
# buildpack-specific data

[[or]]

[[or.provides]]
name = "<dependency name>"

[[or.requires]]
name = "<dependency name>"

[or.requires.metadata]
# buildpack-specific data

```  

## Key Points
  
* A valid `build plan` is a plan where all required dependencies are provided in the necessary order, meaning that during the `build` phase, each component buildpack will have its required dependencies provided by component buildpack or an image extension that runs before it.
* Each pairing of `requires` and `provides` sections (at the top level, or inside of an `or` array) is a potential build plan. For more details, see the [JVM buildpack](https://buildpacks.io/docs/for-buildpack-authors/how-to/write-buildpacks/use-build-plan/#example-jvm-buildpack) example.
* A group will only pass detection if a valid build plan can be produced from the dependencies that all elements in the group require and provide.
* The `detect` phase could fail if a buildpack requires a dependency that it does not itself provide, or is not provided by another buildpack.
* The `detect` phase could also fail when the buildpacks order is incorrect, i.e, the buildpacks providing dependencies run `after` the buildpacks requiring them.
* The resulting `build plan` is passed as one of the inputs to the `build` phase.
