A `buildpack package` refers to the process of packaging buildpacks for distribution as OCI images or OCI-compatible `tar` files.

A `buildpack package` typically encapsulates the scripts, required dependencies, and metadata needed to transform application source code into a fully operational application within a specific platform's runtime environment.
