## Composite Buildpacks

A **composite buildpack** is a buildpack that doesn't contain any `/bin/detect` or `/bin/build` executables; instead it references other buildpacks in its `buildpack.toml` via the [[order]] array. Composite buildpacks MUST be [resolvable](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/buildpack.md#order-resolution) into a collection of component buildpacks.
