A `platform` orchestrates [builds][build] by invoking the [lifecycle] binary together with [buildpacks][buildpack] and
application source code to produce a runnable OCI image.

<!--more-->

## Examples

Examples of a platform might include:

* A local CLI tool that uses buildpacks to create OCI images. One such tool is the [Pack CLI][pack]
* A plugin for a continuous integration service that uses buildpacks to create OCI images. One such plugin is the [buildpacks][buildpacks-tekton] plugin in [Tekton]
* A cloud application platform that uses buildpacks to build source code before deployment. One such platform is [kpack][kpack]

## API

The platform [specification][spec] details what a platform does, and how it interacts with lifecycles and builders.

For the latest version of the Platform API, see [releases][releases] on the spec repo.
