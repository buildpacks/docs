You can use buildpacks to build container images that run Windows containers on Windows (WCOW).

This page is not relevant if your host machine is Windows but you are running Linux containers on Windows (LCOW);
in this case, no special configuration is required.

<!--more-->

> **EXPERIMENTAL** Windows support is experimental!
>
> Enable experimental mode by running: `pack config experimental true`

### Before You Start

#### Recommended reading

Before trying out builds for Windows images, we recommend following the [Linux image tutorial][app-journey] under [Getting Started][getting-started]. Don't worry, you can still run it on a Windows OS if you need to -- just make sure to [enable Linux containers][container-mode] for Docker first.

When you're done, head back here.

#### Enable Windows container mode

In order to produce Windows container images, ensure [Windows container mode][container-mode] is enabled in your Docker settings (available only in Docker for Windows).

Then, building a Windows app using Cloud Native Buildpacks is nearly identical to [building for Linux][build-linux].

### 0. Determine Windows Version

Before we can start, we'll want to match your Windows environment.

Type the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion" | Format-Table -Property ReleaseId, CurrentBuild
```

Select the output that best matches your environment:
{{< page-replace-toggle >}}
{{< page-replace-toggle-option search="1809|2004|2022" replace="1809" >}} Release ID: 1809, Build: <i>any</i> {{< /page-replace-toggle-option >}}
{{< page-replace-toggle-option search="1809|2004|2022" replace="2004" >}} Release ID: 2009, Build: 1904<i>x</i> {{< /page-replace-toggle-option >}}
{{< page-replace-toggle-option search="1809|2004|2022" replace="2022" >}} Release ID: 2009, Build: 2200<i>x</i> {{< /page-replace-toggle-option >}}
{{< /page-replace-toggle >}}

### 1. Select a builder

To [build][build] an app you must first decide which [builder][builder] you're going to use. A builder
includes the [buildpacks][buildpack] that will be used as well as the environment for building your
app.

For this guide we're going to use a sample builder, `docker.io/cnbs/sample-builder:dotnet-framework-1809`.

### 2. Build your app

Now we can build our app. For this example we'll use our [samples][samples] repo for simplicity.

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/buildpacks/samples

# change directory to samples
cd samples

# build the app
pack build sample-app --path apps/aspnet --builder docker.io/cnbs/sample-builder:dotnet-framework-1809 --trust-builder
```

> **TIP:** The builder may take a few minutes to download on the first use.

> **TIP:** If you don't want to keep specifying a builder every time you build, you can set it as your default
> builder by running `pack config default-builder <BUILDER>`.

### 3. Run it

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 sample-app
```

**Congratulations!**

The app should now be running and accessible via [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Using remote Docker hosts

`pack` and your source code don't need to be on the same machine as your Docker daemon, thanks to support for the [`DOCKER_HOST`][docker-env-vars] environment variable. 

Essentially, this points your local Docker client (e.g. `docker` or `pack` CLI) to a remote Docker daemon. For instance, if the IP address of your host is `10.0.0.1` and its daemon is listening on port `2375`, you can set `DOCKER_HOST` to `tcp://10.0.0.1:2375`. Any subsequent `pack` or `docker` commands would communicate with the daemon on that machine instead of a local daemon.

This can be used to make `pack` build Windows container images, as long as your remote Docker host is configured to support them (i.e. the host runs a Windows OS, has [Windows container mode enabled][container-mode]).

Here's an example where `pack` on a Linux/MacOS machine can access a Windows 10 machine with Docker Desktop, using the [localhost:2375 listener][docker-general-settings] and the built-in [OpenSSH Server][windows-openssh-server].  
```
# ssh port-forward for localhost:2375 to remote daemon
ssh -f -N -L 2375:127.0.0.1:2375 10.0.0.1

# set to your local forwarded port
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375

# build the app
pack build sample-app --path samples/apps/aspnet --builder docker.io/cnbs/sample-builder:dotnet-framework-1809 --trust-builder

# run it
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 sample-app

# access your app on your remote docker host
curl http://10.0.0.1:8080
```

> **NOTE**: When setting `DOCKER_HOST`, keep in mind:
>
> - never expose an insecure Docker daemon to an untrusted network. Use SSH port forwarding or [mTLS][protect-the-daemon-socket] instead.
> - any volumes mounted via `pack build --volume <volume> ...` or `docker run --volume <volume> ...` must exist on the _docker host_, not the client machine.
> - any ports published via `docker run --publish <host-port>:<container-port> ...` will be published on the _docker host_, not the client machine.
