[Gitlab][about-gitlab] is a web based DevOps platform. It uses [`pack`][pack] as part of the [Auto DevOps][devops] feature, to
build applications prior to deploying them.
<!--more-->

## Use
To use the CNB integration, you need to configure the Auto DevOps feature, as discussed in [the DevOps guide][devops-guide]. At that point,
you can opt in to using Cloud Native Buildpacks by following the steps in their [CNB documentation][use-cnbs].

This may look like the following in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:
```yaml
include:
  - template: Auto-DevOps.gitlab-ci.yml

variables:
  AUTO_DEVOPS_BUILD_IMAGE_CNB_ENABLED: "true"
```
