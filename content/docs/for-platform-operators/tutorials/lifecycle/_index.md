A `platform` orchestrates builds by invoking the [lifecycle][lifecycle] binary together with buildpacks and application source code to produce a runnable `OCI image`.

<!--more-->

The majority of Buildpack users use community-maintained platforms, such as [pack][pack] and [kpack][kpack], to run Buildpacks and create `OCI images`. However this might not be desireable especially for users maintaining their own platforms and seeking more control over how the underlying Buildpack `lifecycle phases` are executed.

> This tutorial is derived from a [blog post][blog post] contributed by one of our community members.

In this step-by-step tutorial, you will build a `Bash` application without using any `platform` tooling like `pack` or `kpack`. You will also leverage the individual `lifecycle phases` to produce a runnable application image.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial has been tested on linux amd64 and darwin arm64 platforms. You'll need to clone a local copy of the following to get started:

* The CNB `lifecycle`
  
  ```text
  git clone https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle
  ```

* The official `Buildpack.io` samples repo
  
  ```text
  git clone https://github.com/buildpacks/samples
  ```

As previously mentioned, the `lifecycle` orchestrates `Buildpacks` then assembles the resulting artifacts into an `OCI image`.  The `lifecycle` is composed of a series of distinct `phases` that need to be executed to have the final image built and exported.

## Overview

Now that you’re set up, let’s build our `Bash` application and dive deeper into the `lifecycle` and its phases.

### Build the lifecycle

As a starting step, you need to build the `lifecycle` in order to use its phases. This could be done by navigating to the `lifecycle` directory and executing one of the following commands, depending on your system architecture.

* `make build-linux-amd64` for `AMD64` architectures (for Linux users)
* `make build-darwin-arm64` for `ARM64` architectures (for Mac users)

> Please note that the entire process is most easily followed on Linux systems

### Set environment variables

In order to execute the various `lifecycle phases` correctly, you first need to set the values of few important environment variables by running the following commands in the terminal:

```text
export CNB_USER_ID=$(id -u) CNB_GROUP_ID=$(id -g) CNB_PLATFORM_API=0.14
export CNB_SAMPLES_PATH="/<your-path>/samples"
export CNB_LIFECYCLE_PATH="/<your-path/lifecycle/out/<your-os-arch>/lifecycle"
```

Where

* `CNB_USER_ID` and `CNB_GROUP_ID` are arbitrary values that need to be consistent. This example re-uses our user id and group id for the `CNB` user.  In a production system, these are commonly set to `1000`.
* `CNB_PLATFORM_API` or the `Platform API` version, varies depending on the use case. This tutorial uses `v0.14`, which is the latest [Platform API][Platform API] version.
* `CNB_SAMPLES_PATH` represents the path of our local copy of the `samples` directory.
* `CNB_LIFECYCLE_PATH` represents the path of our local compiled `lifecycle` directory.

### Examine lifecycle phases

A single app image build consists of the following phases:

1. [Analysis](#analyze)
2. [Detection](#detect)
3. [Cache Restoration](#restore)
4. [Build](#build)
5. [Export](#export)

> Note that a `platform` executes the phases above either by invoking phase-specific lifecycle binaries in order or by executing `/cnb/lifecycle/creator`.

Let's expand each `lifecycle` phase to explain how the `lifecycle` orchestrates buildpacks:

#### Analyze

The `analyze` phase runs before the `detect` phase in order to validate registry access for all images used during the `build` as early as possible. In this way it provides faster failures for end users.

Prior to executing `/cnb/lifecycle/analyzer`, you need to create two directories in the `root` directory as follows:

```text
mkdir -p apps/bash-script
mkdir -p layers
```

* `apps` directory that contains a `bash-script` directory
* `layers` directory that contains subdirectories representing each layer created by the Buildpack in the final image or build cache.

Next,  you need to copy the `bash-script` samples into our `apps/bash-script` directory, which will host our app's source code.

```text
cp -r "${CNB_SAMPLES_PATH}/apps/bash-script/*" ./apps/bash-script
```

Now, you can invoke the `analyzer` for `AMD64` architecture

```text
${CNB_LIFECYCLE_PATH}/analyzer -log-level debug -daemon -layers="./layers" -run-image cnbs/sample-stack-run:jammy apps/bash-script
```

Or if you are on an `ARM64` platform

```text
${CNB_LIFECYCLE_PATH}/analyzer -log-level debug -daemon -layers="./layers" -run-image arm64v8/ubuntu:latest apps/bash-script
```

The commands above run the `analyzer` with:

* A `debug` logging level
* Pointing to the local `Docker daemon` as the repository where the lifecycle should look for images
* Pointing to the `layers` directory, which is the `lifecycle`'s main working directory
* Pointing to a `run` image, the base image for the application
* Specifying a name for the final application image

Now the `analyzer`:

* Checks the image repository (`daemon` in this case) for a previous image called `apps/bash-script`
* Reads metadata from the previous image (if it exists) for later use
* Verifies that have permission to create or update the image called `apps/bash-script` in the image repository

In this tutorial, there is no previous `apps/bash-script` image, and the output produced should be similar to the following:

```text
sample-stack-run:jammy apps/bash-script
Starting analyzer...
Parsing inputs...
Ensuring privileges...
Executing command...
Timer: Analyzer started at 2024-09-30T07:38:14Z
Image with name "apps/bash-script" not found
Image with name "cnbs/sample-stack-run:jammy" not found
Timer: Analyzer ran for 41.92µs and ended at 2024-09-30T07:38:14Z
Run image info in analyzed metadata is: 
{"Reference":"","Image":"cnbs/sample-stack-run:jammy","Extend":false,"target":{"os":"linux","arch":"amd64"}}
```

Now if you `cat ./layers/analyzed.toml`, you should see a few null entries, a `run-image` section that records the provided name provided, and the found `os/arch`.

#### Detect

In this phase, the `detector` looks for an ordered group of buildpacks that will be used during the `build` phase. The `detector` requires an `order.toml` file to be provided. We can derive an order from `builder.toml` in the `samples` directory while removing the deprecated `stack` section as follows:

```text
cat "${CNB_SAMPLES_PATH}/builders/jammy/builder.toml" | grep -v -i "stack" | sed 's/\.\.\/\.\./\./' > order.toml

```

`order.toml` files contain a list of groups with each group containing a list of buildpacks. The `detector` reads `order.toml` and looks for the first group that passes the detection process.

##### Set buildpacks layout directory

Before running the `detector`, you need to:

1. Create a `buildpacks` directory in the `root` directory

    ```text
    mkdir -p buildpacks
    ```

2. Then you must populate the `buildpacks` directory with your buildpacks of interest.

    > You have to follow the [directory layout][directory layout] defined in the buildpack spec, where each top-level directory is a `buildpack ID` and each second-level directory is a `buildpack version`.

    We will use [`dasel`](http://github.com/tomwright/dasel/) to help us parse toml files.

    ```command
    $ go install github.com/tomwright/dasel/v2/cmd/dasel@master

    Let’s do that for every buildpack in the `samples/buildpacks` directory:

    ```text
    for f in $(ls --color=no ${CNB_SAMPLES_PATH}/buildpacks | grep -v README)
    do
    bp_version=$(cat ${CNB_SAMPLES_PATH}/buildpacks/$f/buildpack.toml | dasel -r toml buildpack.version | sed s/\'//g);
    mkdir -p ./buildpacks/samples_"${f}"/${bp_version}
    cp -r "$CNB_SAMPLES_PATH/buildpacks/${f}/" ./buildpacks/samples_"${f}"/${bp_version}/
    done
    ```

Now, you can run the `detector` binary:

```text
${CNB_LIFECYCLE_PATH}/detector -log-level debug -layers="./layers" -order="./order.toml" -buildpacks="./buildpacks" -app apps/bash-script
```

The output of the above command should have `layers/group.toml` and `layers/plan.toml` output files (i.e., the groups that have passed the detection have been written into the `group.toml` file writing its build plan into the `plan.toml` file)

```text

You can view more details about the [order](https://buildpacks.io/docs/for-platform-operators/concepts/lifecycle/detect/#ordertoml), [group](https://buildpacks.io/docs/for-platform-operators/concepts/lifecycle/detect/#grouptoml) and [plan](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/lifecycle/detect/#plantoml) toml files in the platform documentation.

#### Restore

The `restorer` copies cache contents, if there is a cache, into the build container. This avoids buildpacks having to re-download build-time dependencies that were downloaded during a previous build.

First, you need to create the `cache` directory, and then run the `restorer` binary as added below:

```text
mkdir cache
```

```text
${CNB_LIFECYCLE_PATH}/restorer -log-level debug -daemon -layers="./layers" -group="./layers/group.toml" -cache-dir="./cache" -analyzed="./layers/analyzed.toml"
```

The `cache` directory should now be populated by two sub-directories, `committed` and `staging` as shown in the output below:

```text

Parsing inputs...
Ensuring privileges...
Executing command...

```

#### Build

The `builder` run buildpacks, that do the actual work of transforming application source code into runnable artifacts.

Before running the `builder`, the following steps are required:

1. Create two directories:
   * `platform` directory to store platform configuration and environment variables
   * `workspace` directory to store the application source code
  
    ```text
    mkdir -p platform
    mkdir -p workspace
    ```

2. Copy the source code from the `app` directory to the `workspace` directory

    ```text
    cp -r apps/bash-script/* ./workspace
    ```

3. Create a `launcher` file with instructions to run your application

    ```text
    mkdir -p layers/samples_hello-moon
    cat << EOF > ./layers/samples_hello-moon/launch.toml
    [[processes]]
    type = "shell"
    command = ["./app.sh"]
    EOF
    ```

Now you're ready to run the `builder` as follows:

```text
${CNB_LIFECYCLE_PATH}/builder -log-level debug -layers="./layers" -group="./layers/group.toml" -analyzed="./layers/analyzed.toml" -plan="./layers/plan.toml" -buildpacks="./buildpacks" -app="./workspace" -platform="./platform"
```

Taking a look at the following output shows that you have invoked the two buildpacks that we need in order to run our `bash-script` application.

#### Export

The purpose of the `export` phase is to create a new `OCI` image using a combination of remote layers, local `<layers>/<layer>` layers, and the processed `app` directory.

To export the artifacts built by the `builder`, you first need to specify where to find the `launcher` executable that will be bundled into your image as the entrypoint to run:

* For AMD64 architectures
  
  ```text
  export CNB_LINUX_LAUNCHER_PATH=/<your-path>/lifecycle/out/linux-amd64/lifecycle/launcher
  ```

* For ARM64 Architectures

  ```text
  export CNB_LINUX_LAUNCHER_PATH=/<your-path>/lifecycle/out/linux-arm64/lifecycle/launcher
  ```

Now you can run the `exporter`:

```text
${CNB_LIFECYCLE_PATH}/exporter --log-level debug -launch-cache "./cache" -daemon -cache-dir "./cache" -analyzed "./layers/analyzed.toml" -group "./layers/group.toml" -layers="./layers" -app "./workspace" -launcher="${CNB_LINUX_LAUNCHER_PATH}" apps/bash-script
```

You can verify that the image was successfully exported by running the `docker images` command.

### Run the app image

Finally, you can run the exported image as follows:

```text
docker run -it apps/bash-script ./app.sh
```

```text
OUTPUT PLACEHOLDER
```

## Wrapping up

At the end of this tutorial, we hope that you now have a better understanding of what happens during each lifecycle phase, and how you could use `Buildpacks` to create container images. You are now ready to explore this technology further and customize it to fit your application development and deployment needs.
