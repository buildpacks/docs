From version [0.11.0](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/releases/tag/v0.11.0) onward, `pack` can be used to identify builders that should be considered trusted. `pack build` will operate slightly differently under the hood based on whether it considers the specified builder to be trusted.

Read the [announcement](https://medium.com/buildpacks/faster-more-secure-builds-with-pack-0-11-0-4d0c633ca619).

## What is a Trusted Builder?
When `pack` considers a builder to be trusted, `pack build` operations will use a single lifecycle binary called the `creator`.

If `pack` doesn't trust a builder it will continue to execute five separate lifecycle binaries: `detect`, `analyze`, `restore`, `build` and `export`. It will run the more privileged phases using a published [lifecycle image][lifecycle-image], if one is available.

This choice strikes a balance between security and performance. The `analyze`, `restore` and `export` phases of the lifecycle require higher levels of privilege or access to sensitive data that is not required by the `detect` and `build` phases.

## Why use a Trusted Builder?
When `pack` trusts a builder `pack build` will run a single lifecycle binary which will flow through the five lifecycle steps in a single container. This is more efficient than running five separate containers.

If `pack` were to use the `creator` lifecycle phase with an untrusted builder, each of the buildpack's `bin/detect` and `bin/build` processes would run within a container that has heightened privileges or access to registry credentials. The buildpacks distributed with the untrusted builder could be constructed to act maliciously with these privileges or credentials.

## Which Builders are trusted?
You may view which builders are trusted via  [`pack config trusted-builders list`](/docs/for-platform-operators/how-to/integrate-ci/pack/cli/pack_config_trusted-builders_list/).

Here are some other related commands:

* By default, any builder suggested by  [`pack builder suggest`](/docs/for-platform-operators/how-to/integrate-ci/pack/cli/pack_builder_suggest/) is considered trusted.
* Any other builder can be trusted using  [`pack config trusted-builders add <builder-name>`](/docs/for-platform-operators/how-to/integrate-ci/pack/cli/pack_config_trusted-builders_add/).

* To stop trusting a builder use [`pack config trusted-builders remove <builder-name>`](/docs/for-platform-operators/how-to/integrate-ci/pack/cli/pack_config_trusted-builders_remove/).

* You may trust any builder for the duration of a single build by using the `--trust-builder` flag with [`pack build`](/docs/for-platform-operators/how-to/integrate-ci/pack/cli/pack_build/).

> **Note:** A published lifecycle image is available for lifecycle versions 0.7.5+ and 0.6.1. If your builder has been created with an earlier version of the lifecycle `pack build` will **fail** due to this security related change.

> If you want to trust this older builder, you may mark it as trusted via `pack trust-builder <builder-name>` or by adding `--trust-builder` to the `pack build` command.
