[CircleCI][circleci] is a continuous integration and delivery platform.

The CNB project maintains an integration, called an [orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/), 
which allows users to run [pack][pack] commands inside their pipelines.

<!--more-->

## Use
To use the CNB integration, you need to declare that you are using the [`buildpacks/pack` orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/buildpacks/pack), and then use
it in your workflow.

For instance, your `.circleci/config.yml` file may look like this:
```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  pack: buildpacks/pack@0.2.0
workflows:
  main:
    jobs:
      - pack/build:
          image-name: sample
          builder: 'docker.io/paketobuildpacks/builder:base'
```

For more precise steps, see the `pack-orb` [documentation][pack-orb-docs]
