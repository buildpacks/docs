    Cloud Native Buildpacks makes building container images as easy as running “pack build.” However,
    you will eventually want to customize that out-of-the-box experience. This talk explores the many
    buildpacks extension points that enable custom workflows. For application developers, we introduce
    inline buildpacks and build time environment variables. For platform operators, we present image
    extension with Dockerfiles, and how to control the level of customization available in order to
    adhere to security requirements.

    Cloud Native Buildpacks transform your application source code into images that can run on any cloud.
    In this session you'll learn the basics of using buildpacks, why they make a great choice over the
    alternatives, and what new features the project has to offer. Cloud Native Buildpacks embrace modern
    container standards, such as the OCI image format. They take advantage of the latest capabilities of
    these standards, such as cross-repository blob mounting and image layer "rebasing" on Docker API v2
    registries.

    In this talk we will explore how lifecycle - the binary at the heart of buildpacks - makes all this possible.
    We will be going through the 5 different stages that the lifecycle executes - detect, analyze, restore, 
    build and finally export and how it stitches up the final OCI image.

    Dive into some new functionality of Cloud Native Buildpacks which can be powerful in the enterprise
    context, such as the ability to narrowly define trusted builders, allowing developers and operators
    to restrict access to registry credentials, as well as the ability to create Windows images in a
    number of CI/CD systems, including Tekton, Gitlab and CircleCI.

  description: >-
    Learn why you need a buildpack and how to create one. We'll take advantage of caching and Docker
    layers to speed up rebuilds and deploys. Unlike Dockerfiles, buildpacks are composable. Finally,
    you'll learn how to rebase your application layers on a new image. This allow operators to efficiently
    handle the delivery of OS-level dependency upgrades.

  presenters:
    - Danielle Adams, Heroku
  description: >-
    Buildpacks are the core of Heroku - they lower the operational burden of creating and maintaining
    application environments. Cloud Native Buildpacks combine Heroku’s seamless developer experience
    with modern container standards, making it easy to build Docker images from Node.js source code.
    In this talk, Node developers can learn how to perform both OS and application-level upgrades,
    create Docker images without Dockerfiles, and run containerized Node.js apps with little
    configuration. (Docker experience not required.)

  presenters:
    - Emily Casey, Pivotal
    - Joe Kutner, Heroku
  description: >-
    Are you a developer that would rather build features than maintain Dockerfiles? Is your organization
    excited about Kubernetes but worried about patching vulnerable dependencies across a great number of
    containers? In this talk, you’ll learn how to use the pack CLI to go from source to image in seconds
    and patch a pod even faster. Cloud Foundry and Heroku users have long appreciated the developer
    experience and security guarantees provided by buildpacks. Cloud-Native Buildpacks (a CNCF sandbox
    project) represents a generational leap in buildpacks, bringing the power of buildpacks to k8s and
    beyond.
