    <h2>What Are Buildpacks?</h2>

    <section class="row">
    <div class="col-sm">
      <p>Buildpacks provide a higher-level abstraction for building apps compared to Dockerfiles.</p>

      <p>Specifically, buildpacks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide a balance of control that reduces the operational burden on developers and supports enterprise operators who manage apps at scale.</li>
        <li>Ensure that apps meet security and compliance requirements without developer intervention.</li>
        <li>Provide automated delivery of both OS-level and application-level dependency upgrades, efficiently handling day-2 app operations that are often difficult to manage with Dockerfiles.</li>
        <li>Rely on compatibility guarantees to safely apply patches without rebuilding artifacts and without unintentionally changing application behavior.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
      <p>Buildpacks were first conceived by Heroku in 2011. Since then, they have been adopted by Cloud Foundry and other PaaS such as Gitlab, Knative, Deis, Dokku, and Drie.</p>

      <p>The <b>Cloud Native Buildpacks</b> project was initiated by Pivotal and Heroku in January 2018 and joined the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Sandbox</a> in October 2018. The project aims to unify the buildpack ecosystems with a <a href="https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/master/buildpack.md" target="blank">platform-to-buildpack contract</a> that is well-defined and that incorporates learnings from maintaining production-grade buildpacks for years at both Pivotal and Heroku.</p>

      <p>Cloud Native Buildpacks embrace modern container standards, such as the OCI image format. They take advantage of the latest capabilities of these standards, such as cross-repository blob mounting and image layer "rebasing" on Docker API v2 registries.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started with Cloud Native Buildpacks</h2>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm">
        <p>Until cloud platforms such as Heroku and Cloud Foundry incorporate the <a href="https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle" target="blank">Buildpack v3 Lifecycle</a>, the fastest way to try Cloud Native Buildpacks is via the <code class="highlight">pack</code> CLI, which integrates with your local Docker daemon.</p>

          <h3>This project is still new!</h3>
          <p>Currently only a few buildpacks support the Buildpack v3 API. That said, we're actively adding v3 support to existing buildpacks.</p>
