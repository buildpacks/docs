  <h2>What Are Buildpacks?</h2>

    <div class="col-sm">
      <p>Buildpacks provide a higher-level abstraction for building apps compared to Dockerfiles.</p>

      <p>Specifically, buildpacks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide a balance of control that reduces the operational burden on developers and supports enterprise operators who manage apps at scale.</li>
        <li>Ensure that apps meet security and compliance requirements without developer intervention.</li>
        <li>Provide automated delivery of both OS-level and application-level dependency upgrades, efficiently handling day-2 app operations that are often difficult to manage with Dockerfiles.</li>
        <li>Rely on compatibility guarantees to safely apply patches without rebuilding artifacts and without unintentionally changing application behavior.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
      <p>Buildpacks were first conceived by Heroku in 2011. Since then, they have been adopted by Cloud Foundry and other PaaS such as Gitlab, Knative, Deis, Dokku, and Drie.</p>

      <p>The <b>Cloud Native Buildpacks</b> project was initiated by Pivotal and Heroku in January 2018 and joined the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Sandbox</a> in October 2018. The project aims to unify the buildpack ecosystems with a <a href="https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/master/buildpack.md" target="blank">platform-to-buildpack contract</a> that is well-defined and that incorporates learnings from maintaining production-grade buildpacks for years at both Pivotal and Heroku.</p>

      <p>Cloud Native Buildpacks embrace modern container standards, such as the OCI image format. They take advantage of the latest capabilities of these standards, such as cross-repository blob mounting and image layer "rebasing" on Docker API v2 registries.</p>
